# Project Description

This repository provides a NumPy-only implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The entire network is built from scratch without using any deep learning libraries; this was done to understand and implement CNNs from a mathematical standpoint, exploring the underlying equations and operations that drive these models. The architecture consists of a single convolutional layer with two 3×3 filters (sigmoid activations), followed by 2×2 average-pooling, flattening, and a 1×1 fully connected layer producing logits over ten classes. Input images are normalized to the \[0, 1] range and labels are one-hot encoded. All forward- and backward-propagation steps (including convolution, pooling, cross-entropy loss calculation, gradient derivation, and weight updates) are implemented manually in NumPy.

Training runs for ten epochs on the 60 000-sample training set using a learning rate of 0.01, with average training loss reported each epoch. Evaluation on the 10 000-sample test set yields classification accuracy in the high-80 percent to low-90 percent range, depending on weight initialization. The codebase is organized into modular functions (`load_data`, `initialize_weights`, `forward_propagation`, `backward_propagation`, `train`, and `evaluate`) to clearly demonstrate each stage of feature extraction and parameter optimization using only NumPy operations.
